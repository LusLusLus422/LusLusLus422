## Knowledge Architecture & Applied NLP

I aim to design systems that orchestrate personal knowledge management, language processing, and local-first AI workflows. My work sits at the intersection of structured thinking, semantic search, and human-centered tooling.

I’m currently building SUPPLE, a modular PKM engine that integrates embeddings, local LLMs, and a clean data layer to create a more coherent and resilient knowledge environment. Much of this involves experimenting with LLaMA-based pipelines, SQL-driven schemas, and lightweight interfaces that make captured information more usable.

My interests extend into data-driven art and language structures, especially the contrasts and translations between Guaraní and European linguistic frameworks. These investigations shape how I approach cognition, narrative, and interface design, and they inform my ongoing work with the FINKE ESTATE Art Archive, where I explore archival material through computational methods, metadata structuring, and experimental visual mappings.

Across projects, I focus on designing workflows that help people think more clearly, organize knowledge with less friction, and build habits around meaningful creation. My approach is iterative, systems-oriented, and grounded in real use rather than abstraction.

If a problem involves structure, semantics, or human workflow design, it usually interests me.
